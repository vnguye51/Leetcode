    "The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The idea behind this problem is to recursively check all valid positions on the board while continually eliminating more and more spots resulting in an N! solution\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create the board\n",
    "    * . is unoccupied and valid\n",
    "    * Q is occupied\n",
    "* When a Queen is placed all diagonals,rows and columns are eliminated from needing to be checked\n",
    "    * We are iterating top-down so there is no need to check rows\n",
    "    * We track columns through an array if column[x] = 1 then column x is eliminated and we can check this later down\n",
    "    * We do the same for the diagonals right_diag[x+y] = 1 then diag[x+y] is eliminated, where is the row placed and y is the col placed\n",
    "    To check if a spot is valid check column[x], right_diag[x+y] and diag[x+y] if all of them are false\n",
    "\n",
    "* For all the valid(not in collision with any other queen) attempt to create a board from that spot\n",
    "    * To determine if it is a valid spot to place a queen \n",
    "* Each of these will represent a branch in our N! tree\n"
