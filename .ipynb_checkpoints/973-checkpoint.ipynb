    "We have a list of points on the plane.  Find the K closest points to the origin (0, 0).\n",

    "(Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)\n",

    "    Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], K = 1\n",

    "    Explanation: \n",
    "    The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).\n",
    "    The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).\n",
    "    Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.\n",
    "    We only want the closest K = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], K = 2\n",
    "    Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]\n",
    "    (The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.)\n",

    "* We need to sort the array by its squares and then return that value\n",
