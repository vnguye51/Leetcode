    "Given a string s1, we may represent it as a binary tree by partitioning it to two non-empty substrings recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is one possible representation of s1 = \"great\":\n",
    "\n",
    "        great\n",
    "       /    \\\n",
    "      gr    eat\n",
    "     / \\    /  \\\n",
    "    g   r  e   at\n",

    "\n",
    "    To scramble the string, we may choose any non-leaf node and swap its two children.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, if we choose the node \"gr\" and swap its two children, it produces a scrambled string \"rgeat\".\n",

    "              a   t\n",
    "\n",
    "    We say that \"rgeat\" is a scrambled string of \"great\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    Similarly, if we continue to swap the children of nodes \"eat\" and \"at\", it produces a scrambled string \"rgtae\".\n",
