    "Our original representation never had extraneous zeroes, so we never started with numbers like \"00\", \"0.0\", \"0.00\", \"1.0\", \"001\", \"00.01\", or any other number that can be represented with less digits.  Also, a decimal point within a number never occurs without at least one digit occuring before it, so we never started with numbers like \".1\".\n",
